# This project is about the scalability issue in duplicate detection. The proposed algorithm is applied on a data set of television descriptions. In   duplicate detection, scalability of algorithms is a large issue. Hence, we propose an algorithm that uses LSH to preselect candidate duplicate pairs, in order to reduce the computation time of our algorithm. 

# The code provided is written in Python. It consist of several function that clean data, construct binary matrices and most importantly: perform LSH. At the end of the code, the function Performance is found. This function uses all other function to directly run the whole algorithm. With a few imputs, this function can be used to evaluate LSH. The data set used is a JSON file containing 1,624 observations of televisions.
